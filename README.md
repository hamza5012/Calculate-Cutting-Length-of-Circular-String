üìè **Calculate Cutting Length of Circular String**

Are you working on reinforced concrete structures? Need a quick way to calculate the cutting length of a circular stirrup? Look no further!

I've developed a simple Python script that computes the cutting length of a circular stirrup around a column. This tool takes into account parameters like the diameter of the column, clear cover, and stirrup diameter to give you accurate results in no time.

With just a few inputs, you can swiftly determine the cutting length, streamlining your reinforcement detailing process and ensuring precision in your construction projects.

Feel free to check it out and incorporate it into your workflow for efficient structural design and analysis.
